# 23-2 Computer Architecture
# 04 ISA_2

- Common HW design for MIPS ISA
- CPU, registers, and memory
• Control unit (CU) directs the operation of the processor
• Arithmetic & logic unit (ALU) does the operation
• $0, … , $31 hold the value that will be used in the operation (called general purpose registers)
• Program counter (PC) contains the memory address of the instruction will be executed
• Instruction register (IR) contains the current instruction
